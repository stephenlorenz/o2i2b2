o2i2b2
======

This tool and corresponding XML schema (XSD) are designed to assist in the porting of data into i2b2.  The tool, the i2b2Import application, is implemented in Java and can be run by calling the executable Jar file or by running the convenience Windows executable.  The Windows executable simply wraps the jar file into a self-executing program.    You can find more information on i2b2 here: http://www.i2b2.org
